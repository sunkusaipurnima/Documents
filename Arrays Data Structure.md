## Arrays Data Structure

What are Arrays?

An array is a data structure for storing more than one data item that has a similar data type. The items of an array are allocated at adjacent memory locations. These memory locations are called elements of that array.

 

The total number of elements in an array is called length. The details of an array are accessed about its position. This reference is called index or subscript.

 

An array is a container of elements.

Elements have a specific value and data type, like "ABC", TRUE or FALSE, etc.

Each element also has its own index, which is used to access the element.

Note:

 

Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.

An index is always less than the total number of array items.

In terms of syntax, any variable that is declared as an array can store multiple values.
